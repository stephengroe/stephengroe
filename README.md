# Hi! I'm Stephen.

I'm a full-stack developer in Mesa, Arizona.

- ðŸ¤– I'm building a [tiny language model](https://github.com/stephengroe/little-language-model) from scratch in TypeScript.
- ðŸŒµ I keep an updated list of [tech events in the Phoenix area](https://github.com/stephengroe/phx-tech-events).
- ðŸ“š When I'm not coding, you'll find me with a good book, at the gym, or writing something.


ðŸ‘‹ I'm currently open to software engineering roles where I can work on challenging technical problems â€” especially in ML, dev tools, or systems programming. If you're hiring, I'd love to connect.
\

ðŸ’¼ Open to new opportunities â€” building production-grade tools in TypeScript, machine learning, or developer experience. Reach out!
