# Hi! I'm Stephen.

I'm a full-stack developer in Mesa, Arizona.

- ðŸ¤– I'm building a [tiny language model](https://github.com/stephengroe/little-language-model) from scratch in TypeScript.
- ðŸŒµ I keep an updated list of [tech events in the Phoenix area](https://github.com/stephengroe/phx-tech-events).
- ðŸ“š When I'm not coding, you'll find me with a good book, at the gym, or writing something.

ðŸ‘‹ I'm currently open to software engineering roles where I can work on challenging technical problemsâ€”especially in dev tools or ML. If you're hiring, I'd love to connect.
