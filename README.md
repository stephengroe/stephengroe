# Hi! I'm Stephen.

I'm a full-stack developer in Mesa, Arizona.

- 🔧 I currently work at [Brevity](https://www.brevity.io/).
- 🌵 I keep an updated list of [tech events in the Phoenix area](https://github.com/stephengroe/phx-tech-events).
- 💻 I'm developing on a handful of side projects for myself and clients.
- ✍️ I love writing documentation that's clear and easy to understand.
- 📚 When I'm not coding, you'll find me with a good book, at the gym, or writing something.
